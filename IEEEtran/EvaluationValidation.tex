\section{Evaluation and Validation}
\label{eval}
Firstly, \cbc has been validated by industry use case within ASSET project during avionics component development. 
%The outcames of this  – what impact the Aspects make on requirements reviewing process – handle requirements complexity.

Next step for evaluation and validation of \cbc can be series of empirical studies conducting with students, at Fortiss research institute to find out, how a user can handle unstructured system requirements applying \cbc and without \cc. The outcomes will be compared in order to check, whether quality of the considered requirements increases with \cc application. For this purpose criteria of comparison can be defined as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item time-consumption during system development based on the structured and unstructured requirements
	\item comprehension of the structured and unstructured requirements (e.g. time for read and understanding requirements)
	\item number and types of errors have been corrected within reviewing process
\end{itemize}

However, these criteria can vary depending on further results of study.
