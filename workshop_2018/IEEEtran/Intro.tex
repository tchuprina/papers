\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro} 
Initial phase of the system developmet process (Requirements eniniring) orchestrates a how development. It initiates with collecting customers' requirments, those are objectives for a future system; contines with their  analyses and transformations into high level and low level requirmens, those are inputs for system design process; and continues with testing the system design against the requirements. It menas that requirments as an income to szstem development influence the result of this process; opparently,  their quality correlate with the quality of the end product [].  

Still, the question about measureing qaulitz of requirments remains difficult, due to its subjectivity[].

 Here we present our approach to the quality measurement suggesting its mathematical explanation. Comparering with existing approach, ours (name) considers a relation between quality of requirements and the resulted product measuring time and resources consumption for requirements engineering phase and furether software development.
