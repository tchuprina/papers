\begin{abstract}
Initial phase of the system developmet process (Requirements engineering) orchestrates a whole development. Requirements serve as inputs to system development process and their quality have a correlation with the end product. However, vast majority of studies on this theme exist, still the question "how to measure quality of requirements?" remains problematic due to its subjectivity.

In this paper we present our mathematical approach for assessing a quality of requirements based on assumption about a relation between the requirements quality and a quality of the resulting product. Here we consider the corrections in requirements document done within requirements engineering (RE) and software enineering (SE) stages[Farbey,1990], and their influence on the time consuming for development process.

The suggested metric takes into account a maturity of the requirements and reflects its leverage on the product, resulting in a number from 0 (bad) - 1 (good) for a quality assesement.
