\tatiana{Pros:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The proposed metrics provide a uniformity in measurements of requirements quality;

	\item can be used in empirical measurements.
\end{itemize}


\tatiana{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Firstly,  the problem of this approach is: it doesn't take into account the quality of project and its correlation with the requirements quality.
\item Secondly, the approach is theoretic (academic) and has not yet been applied on practice.
